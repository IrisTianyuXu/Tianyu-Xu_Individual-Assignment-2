DOI: https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR37946.v1  
Data Type: Tabular Data, CSV  

This pilot project was aimed at promoting the skills of School Resource Officers (SROs), through an innovative online professional development platform. Conducted in partnership with Florida Public Schools, this project involved the development, testing, and refinement of online modules around trauma-informed care (TIC), social emotional learning (SEL), restorative problem-solving, and cultural competence. After development of the four modules, a small pilot evaluation was conducted with K-12 School Security Professionals to assess for efficacy and scalability. The survey assessed knowledge retention, and gathered demographic information including: age, gender, race/ethnicity, and education level.

## Methodological Information
##### Methods for Data Collection

_Study Design_  
The present study utilized a case study design. Each module's script and supplemental resources were created over the course of approximately three months, totaling one year to create all four modules. Module development began with literature reviews on each topic to determine key competencies for participants, followed by creating a content outline to provide participants with these competencies. After the development of the four modules, a small pilot evaluation was conducted with K-12 School Security Professionals. Participants self-selected to receive the training either at the beginning of the summer (May 2019) or at the end of the summer (August 2019). Cohort 1 (immediate intervention) consisted of participants who selected the early summer training and Cohort 2 (delayed intervention-control group) consisted of participants who selected the later summer training. Participants in Cohort 1 completed a survey after viewing the online professional development modules and Cohort 2 completed the same survey before being offered the training.

_Sample_  
The participating district gave a soft mandate to School Security Professionals, meaning they were not required, but strongly encouraged to do the training modules. Participants were able to self-select into the immediate intervention or delayed intervention-control group.

_Time Method_  
Cross-sectional

_Universe_  
School Security Professionals in Florida, employed by a single school district, in 2019.

_Data Types_  
Survey data

_Presence of Common Scales_  
General Self-Efficacy scale (Schwarzer and Jerusalem, 1995)  
Trauma-Informed Organizational Self-Assessment (Fallot and Harris, 2009)  
Self-Assessment of Social and Emotional Competencies (SASEC) (Yoder, 2014)

##### Methods for Data Processing
We fitted a series of ten linear regression models for each outcome of interest in a posttest-only design to detect differ-ences between SSPs in Cohort 1 (immediate intervention). and Cohort 2 (delayed intervention–control group). Each model included participants’ age, gender, and level of edu-cation for two reasons, to determine whether competencies varied according to demographic differences among partici-pants and to control for any potential differences in the esti-mates of intervention effects.

##### Definitions for Codes or Symbols Used to Record Missing Data
The package MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations) in R was used to handle missing data following the recommendations by Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn (2010). Multiple imputation is an advanced missing data imputation technique that accounts for uncertainty in the imputation process by imputing multi-ple datasets (Zhang, 2016). Multiple imputation by chained equations has been shown to render unbiased estimates of missing data in several simulation studies (Drechsler & Rässler, 2008; Horton & Kleinman, 2007; Van Buuren, Brand, Groothuis-Oudshoorn, & Rubin, 2006). Each linear regression was fitted separately to 100 imputed datasets and the resulting regression parameters were combined. Effect sizes (Cohen’s d, Table 1) were calculated by taking the dif-ference in posttest means for each group and dividing them by the pooled Standard Deviation (Cohen, 1977). Additionally, we conducted a post hoc analysis of the means for each of the outcomes in Cohort 1 (immediate intervention) to determine whether there were significant differences in the outcomes between SSPs that had completed half or more of the modules and those that did not complete at least half of the module.

This was explained in [Espelage, Dorothy L., Valido, Alberto, El Sheikh, America J., Robinson, Luz E., Ingram, Katherine M., Torgal, Cagil, Atria, Catherine G., Chalfant, Pamela K., Nicholson, Angelica M., Salama, Christine D., Poekert, Philip E.

## Reflections
1. _Which metadata standard did you choose and why?_  
  I used the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) because it is an international and shared standard for describing data,
  especially by creating interactive codebooks and building question banks.  
3. _Which template/software did you use?_  
   I used the Markdown on GitHub to write the README file as it is the most common used tools to write README files featuring universal compatibility and easy to learn.  
   I also used Banner Maker and Shields.io to make banner and badges.
4. _What was the most challenging part of creating a ReadME file? How did you overcome these obstacles?_  
   First, although the structure of a README file is clear, it really depend on the file creator about how to present the information,
   specifically where to use headings, italics and how to create tables to make the study more easy to understand.  
   Second, the dataset that I chose has too many variables, so it is a little bit annonying to arrange those variables in tables. Besides, for this assignment, it was not always easy to find all the information that I want in a single website. I need to look into all the research papers citing this dataset to go back to the original study design.  
   Third, it was my first time to use GitHun. So I spent some time to figure out how it works. I even did not save the work proporly and accidentally lost my first version. Therefore, I have to rewrite the whole assignment. I know data management is what we have talked about in previous weeks:(
